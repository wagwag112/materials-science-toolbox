# Materials Science Toolbox
# Computational Materials Science Toolbox

This repository contains my personal collection of tools and automated workflows for materials discovery and analysis.

## 🚀 Key Expertise
* **High-Throughput Screening:** Custom-built Python workflows for large-scale materials property predictions.
* **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIP):** Proficient in applying MLIPs for accelerated atomistic simulations.
* **Density Functional Theory (DFT):** Extensive experience with **VASP** for ground-state and excited-state calculations.

## 🛠 Project Focus
My research focuses on bridging the gap between high-fidelity DFT calculations and large-scale MD simulations using MLIPs. I specialize in developing
automated pipelines to:
1. Generate diverse structural datasets.
2. Automate MLIP training and validation (especially using the UMA framework).
3. Post-process simulation data for ionic conductivity.
